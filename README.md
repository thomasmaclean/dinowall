# Anypixel-Example

This is a small example app built with the Anypixel Framework. 
It draws colorful squares wherever you touch.

To build it:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

To run it, you'll need to install the [previewer app](#) first. Then in the app's root directory, do:
```sh   
preview
```
